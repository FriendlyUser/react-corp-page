### Corporate Landing Page in React

Note I'm aware this website is less than optimial on mobile devices, I think this is a microsoft issue, or I imported the wrong fabric css files.
#### Lessons Learned

* CSS in js
* Animations
* Nextjs + Typescript
* Intersection API (love react-intersection-observer)
* More complex Typescript based React Components (See Carousel)

Although I had experience using Typescript on the backend, Typescript + React had a bit of a learning curve.

The is mainly a learning project for me, learning how to add key animations and use css in js via react.
Learned don't use git lfs if you are serving files from a static site generator, only binaries, not required to run repo.


Using microsoft fabric and server side rendering is a bit of a pain.
