### Corporate Landing Page in React


The is mainly a learning project for me, learning how to add key animations and use css in js via react.
Learned don't use git lfs if you are serving files from a static site generator, only binaries, not required to run repo.


Using microsoft fabric and server side rendering is a bit of a pain.
